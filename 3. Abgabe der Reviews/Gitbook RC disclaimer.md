## 0 Abstract

Social media, once seen as a conduit for democratization around the world, is under fire for becoming a tool for spreading disinformation. This paper examines the idea of applying simple rules to the text output of an NLP model. Our aim is threefold: to identify text generation flaws, try to mitigate them through simple, explainable post processing, and evaluate the efficacy of our method, all within our example domain, German Bundestag Twitter. Our results show that, while the out-of-the-box performance is good already, it can be improved by adapting it to the target domain \(in our case Twitter\). Some flaws can be corrected using basic logic. Our research, as well as interactions with participants of our NLP study, suggests that those improvements are likely to occur in other settings.
