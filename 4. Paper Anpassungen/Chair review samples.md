# Chair Review Beispiele #
Diese Beispiele geben ein Gefühl für die Länge und den Stil eines Chair Reviews.
## Beispiel 1 ##
The reviewers agree on highly recommending this paper. They value the well layed out structure of the paper. The most common complaint is about the related work section. Although there is an expansive, clearly arranged table. This section should present all necessary background information to understand the rest of the paper and give an insight into the relevant works in the field. Specifically, one reviewer recommends to add a short summary of the related works. Perhaps expand the descriptions in the subject column. Other recommendations focus on small details that can be easily fixed.

## Beispiel 2 ##
The reviewers all agree on highly recommending this paper. The paper is very well structured and appropriately presented. The large volume can sometimes be overwhelming, which is why they suggest in the recommendations to shorten some text passages and sections. A common complaint is about the tables, especially in the data section. The latter seems to be rather unfinished or just short. Other recommendations focus on small details that can be easily fixed.

## Beispiel 3 ##
The reviewers disagree on this paper, although two recommend accepting it. The paper is focused on the essentials. A better evaluation is obstructed mainly by the unfinished state. The abstract and the discussion section are missing, and some sections (e. g. ethics) still seem to be work-in-progress. The conclusion should be revised. The reviewers disagree on the reproducibility of the code.

## Beispiel 4 ##
The reviewers agree to recommend this work. The comprehensible structure should be emphasized; in particular, the use of headings is praised. The research question seems scattered throughout the text, which confuses some of the reviewers - clarification in the introduction and conclusion and perhaps references to it throughout the paper would be great. One reviewer thinks the research question and conclusion contradict each other. Two reviewers recommend adding some graphics to support your claims. The related work is very short and should be expanded. Overall, the paper provides a high level of insight into the topic.

## Beispiel 5 ##
The reviewers all agree on recommending or highly recommending this paper. The paper is very well structured and despite its brevity very informative. The Collab Notebook provided describes everything in detail. The reviewers' recommendations focus on the missing abstract, the unclear research question, and the conclusion. Please include an abstract. The research question seems to be indistinct (although you do write something in the introduction), perhaps you should make it explicit and refer to it again in the results and conclusion.  Please expand on the conclusion, especially for application in a real-world context.
This is not to detract from the overall very good work, one reviewer states that anyone could understand your paper the way you wrote it and the reviewers appreciate the excellent evaluation of the paper.
