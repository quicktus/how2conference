## Welcome

We warmly welcome you to the digital ML4B 2021 Conference. 2021 is a very special year for the ML4B Conference since it is held for the first time ever. We are privileged to be the chairs of this exciting conference. Over the last weeks, the ML4B attendees have undertaken tremendous projects. This conference will let us share our thoughts and exchange ideas on how Machine Learning can chart businesses journeys forward to reach new heights. We hope that you will have a productive and fun‚Äêfilled time.

To put a conference of this magnitude together is not a small task. To that end, we want to thank the reviewers for agreeing to help perfecting the technical quality of the submissions and providing recommendations to the chairs as well as all of the conference participants whose contributions are the foundation of this conference.

## Process

### 1 Authors: Submit your paper  

Before you submit your paper for review, we recommend you read the _Reviewer Guidelines_ \(see below\). These can help you adjust your paper to be conference compliant.  
To submit your paper, simply make sure your gitbook page is up to date. You don't need to send it anywhere, the conference chairs will assign your paper to a reviewer. 

### 2 Reviewers: Submit your reviews

The reviews will be blind \(not double-blind\), i.e. the reviewers are anonymous but the authors are known.  
Each person is asked to write two reviews, one for an NLP paper and one on an image processing paper. Unlike before, you will be  working alone on the reviews, _not_ as a team.   
On 05.06.2021, you will receive a direct message providing the two papers to which you have been assigned and links to the corresponding survey which will act as your review. Be sure to read the _Reviewer Guidelines_ again to ensure that your review is conference compliant.

### 3 Authors: Amend your paper & submit your responses

After the reviewers submitted their reviews, you have time to make amendments to your paper. You will receive a link to a form via direct message. Once you are ready, you will need to fill out this form to justify your amendments, or lack thereof, to the reviewers.

### 4 Reviewers: Adjust your reviews accordingly

You will be sent one more form in which you you may adjust your evaluation according to the changes made by the authors. This will serve as a basis for the Chairs who will decide on the final judgment on the Papers.
